    Scripty 運行起來並不便宜。它目前在配備 AMD Ryzen 9 3900 CPU 和 128GB RAM 的 1,500 美元服務器上運行。
    即使有那種硬件，我們估計它也只能同時處理100個轉錄。
    捐贈會讓我們能夠擴展我們的硬件容量和同時處理更多轉錄。
    如果我們有足夠的捐款的話，我們將能夠擴展我們的硬件容量或許我們還能夠同時處理數以千計的轉錄\n\n
    Training a model is not easy either, as that needs relatively recent (CUDA 10.1 support)
    Nvidia GPUs. We hate asking for donations, but we absolutely can't support the bot out of our
    own pockets, since it's just too expensive. So we're asking for help, and giving rewards in the
    form of premium subscriptions.\n\n
    You can view more info at https://scripty.org/premium, but the gist of it is that there are 6
    tiers ranging in price from $5 USD to $100 USD per month. The $100 tier comes with its own
    managed instance of Scripty for your own server, with a custom name, and profile picture.\n\n
    We also support one-time donations directly through GitHub Sponsors:
    { "[https://github.com/sponsors/tazz4843](https://github.com/sponsors/tazz4843?frequency=one-time&sponsor=tazz4843)" }\n\n\n
